# Quote Generator

I built a quote generator with a background color change onclick to brush up my Javascript skills. I got the idea here: https://dev.to/codefoxx/15-beginner-javascript-projects-to-improve-your-front-end-skills-5bcj and my main inspiration was this: https://dev.to/nehasoni__/random-quote-generator-using-html-css-and-javascript-3gbp

I used async function as it was used in the example, but need to practice more to fully understand how it works. I also used an API which didn't require an API Key.
